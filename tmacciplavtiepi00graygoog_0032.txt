nor do their MSS. shew any trace ol such a division. Horace

(ΑΡ. 189) first speaks directly of the regular five Acts, and
critics, eg. Donatus, frequently complain of the difficulty of
dividing the existing plays into Acts. 1f we follow the breaks
in the Epidicus we find six divisions made by the intervals at
16s‚319‚381‚606‚665-.

On the other hand the division into scenes is regularly found
in the MSS. of Plautus and Terence, and the names of the
characters speaking in each are given as headings.

The intervals between the scenes were filled up by the
orchestra, especially by a favourite tibicen, or by the choragus.
There is no change of scenery in the Plautine plays, and save
ior these short pauses filled up by simple music the play goes
right on from the lowering of the curtain at the commencement
, to the raising at the close.

9. Some Poz'rets os Contrast between Greek and Roman
Comedy. The Old Attic Comedy was a passing phase and
could never have been a permanent type. lt was personal and
political. lts end was political satire. Such comedy could
exist only under democracy. lt rose with the democracy and
it fell with the democracy. Even while it flourished Crates
wrote plays more analogous to the original (Sicilian) type. But
the decay os the Old Comedy was no sudden thing. We may
trace the process os disintegration in the later plays of Aristo-
phanes himsell. Thus in the Plutus, which, as it stands, is a
play ol the Middle Comedy, there is no Parabasis, and the
Chorus is magni nominis umbra. When we hear further that
it became very difficult to get people to undertake the large
expenses the Chorus entailed, it is evident that its complete -
disappearance was only a question of time.

Hence in the New Comedy we expect to find neither (1) poli-
tical satire, nor (2) a Chorus. The New Comedy is almost
wholly social-it is the comedy of life and manners, in the sense
in which we now understand the word. And these are the
topics upon which Roman Comedy was based.

The Romans took over the Greek Theatre as a whole. But
their stage, a mere temporary platlorm §pulpitum *aas more
