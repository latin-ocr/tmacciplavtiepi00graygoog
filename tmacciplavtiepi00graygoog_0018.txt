Andronicus introduced this Comedy at Rome first 240 B.c., was
followed by Naevius who like him wrote Tragedies also, then
came Plautus, Caecilius, aud Terentius who exclusively devoted
themselves to comoedia palliata. In fruitfulness os productiori,
independent use os his Greek originals, power of language,
. lively delineation ol character, readiness and wit, Plautus stands
first os all the Roman comedians¹. ¹

Gellius (111. 3) states that 130 pieces passed ‚under Plautus'
name. Servius says in the introduction to his Commentary ou
the Aeneid—‘ Plautus is said by some to have written 21 plays,
by others 40, by others 1003 The large numbers in these
estimates no doubt include some early plays by unknown authors
under the name of Plautus. Varro, who first treated the subject
in anything of a critical spirit, enumerates 21 plays as ascribed
to Plautus in all the lists (indices), all of which we possess except
the Vidularia, which was lost between the 6th and 11th centuries
nn. These are the Fabulae Varronianae. In a second class
Varro places the plays which were set down to Plautus in most
os the lists. This class probably included 19, which with the
21 undoubted comedies would give the 40 of Servius' second
'estimate Outside the 21 undisputed plays we know the titles
only of 32. The extant plays are given in the ordinary MSS. in
the following order: Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Captivi,
Curculio, Casina, Cistellaria, Epidicus, Bacchides Mostellaria,
Menaechmi, Miles Gloriosus, Mercator, Pseudolus, Poenulus, ¹
Persa, Rudens, StichuS, Trinummus, Truculentus. This order
is alphabetical but takes account only oi the initial letter
in the titles; the one case where the initial letter is neglected
-the Bacchides-is to be explained by the fact that an
allusion in the Bacchides shews it to be a later play than the
Epidicus, hence it is placed after the Epidicus in the list. Need-
less to say these do not all possess the same merit, and are not
to be ranked in the same class. Brix calls 6 (Aulularia, Captivi,
Bacchides, Menaechmi, Pseudolus, Trinummus) first-rate-but
there is much to be said against the exclusion of several otherS,
