1429, and t'rom it first the last 12 plays became known-the first
8had been known and copied uninterruptedly. lt is referred to
as D.

(4) Codex J, in the British Museum, assigned by Ritschl to
the 11th cent, containing the first eight plays. lts value is
disputed. Goetz pronounces it to be important, though very
carelessly written.

These four MSS] proceed from one special recension of the
text.

MSS. of the third class resemble J in the first eight, D in
the lastrz plays. They are late in date—15th cent-and unim-
portant ior the criticism of the text. F is used to represent
Codex Lipsiensis—rsth cent-belonging to the University of
Leipzig; Z the editio princeps by G. Merula, Venice 1472.

5. Prosody. Our notions on the scansion os Latin are‘
derived irom Horace, Vergil and Ovid. But their standard,
framed upon Greek models, was impossible lor a writer living
at the time of Plautus. Plautus followed like all early scenic
poets the custom os popular speech in the measuring and
reckoning oi syllables, and generally in questions of scansion
and prosody. The new tendency commences-in Plautus’ lile-
time—with the introduction by Ennius oi the Greek Hexameter.
Hence there arises ior the hexameter a system ol rules aud
a degree of correctness which sharply separated syllables and
assigned them their unvarying metrica] length and value. But
with the lambio and the Trochee oi dramatic poetry the case
was different, not only with Plautus, but with Ennius himself,
Terence, Accius and Pacuvius. Catullus and Horace first ap·
plied to the lambic the Greek rule strictly observed in the
Hexameter.

The Plautine measurement oi syllables thus naturally corre-
sponds to the looseness of popular usage. The sharp rules
for lengthening by position and fixed length had not yet been
introduced. But it is by no means always possible to explain
in all cases the popular usage followed. Thus ferentarius, seddn·
tarius are scanned with the second syllable short. Probably this
