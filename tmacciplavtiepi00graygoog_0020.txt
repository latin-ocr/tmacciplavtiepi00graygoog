many points necessitates often a very wide departure from and
extensive modification of the French playwright’s work1. The
delicate handling of Terence represents much more closely the

style of Menander.
4. Text. The text of Plautus depends on MSS. of three

classes. ln the first class stands a single MS. A, the famous ,

Ambrosian Palimpsest-the oldest Latin MS. extant—now in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan. lt is dated as belonging to the
4th or 5th cent, but the codex was separated and written over
by a monkish scribe in the 7th or 8th cent, and now there
survives about a third part of the leaves with the original
Plautine text under the Vulgate of the monk. imperfect and
difficult to decipher as even this remnant is, it is of supreme
importance for the text of Plautus. Nothing is left of the
Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Curculio, little of the Captivi,
Cistellaria, Vidularia; of the other plays altogether about
half is extant, but in different proportions, so that of the
Pseudolus and Stichus little is wanting ; less than half is lost
of Casina, Persa, Poenulus; about half of Epidicus and Tri-
nummus; more than half of the Bacchides, Mostellaria, Me-
naechmi, Mercator, Miles Gloriosus, Rudens, Truculentus. The
MS. was discovered by Cardinal Mai 1815—an Apograph has
been published by W. Studemund.

the 11th cent, formerly in the Palatine Library at Heidelberg,
since 1622 in the Vatican Library at Rome. lt contains all
20 playS, and is referred to after Ritschl as B.

(2) Codex alter of Camerarius, usually described as Decurtatus
and marked C (rath cent). lt contains the 12 last plays, was
at Heidelberg and Rome with B, but was taken to Paris 1797,
and at the Restoration to Heidelberg.

(3) Ursinianus or Vaticanus—rath cent—contains like C,
which it closely resembles, the last 12 plays with Amphitruo,
Asinaria, Aulularia, and half the Captivi. This MS. was brought
