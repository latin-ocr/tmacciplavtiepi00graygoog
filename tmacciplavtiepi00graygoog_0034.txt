those of Aristophanes. And they give variety, emphasis and
clearness to the whole play. A change of feeling is accompanied
by a change of metre. Lyrics in Roman Comedy are ‘the
medium for the exceptional': accelerated rhythm is used for
any scene of emotion or excitement: the ordinary blank verse

The Greek Comedy allowed incidental effects. Such arethe
scenes in the Birds and the Clouds, where a number of persons

The Frogs may be said to have an under—plot. At first we are
interested mainly in Xanthias, but when the plot proper begins

The scene is Athens. The title-rdle is that of Epidicus the slave

of Periphanes. Periphanes an elderly Athenian and his friend
Apoecides; Stratippocles the son of Periphanes and his friend
Chaeribulus‚ are the most important characters. The interest

the interest of his young master, adroitly entrlcams nmen&
