limited in its resources. The scenery represented a fixed ex-
terior-a street with houses at the back and a narrow lane
(angiportus) between them. The frontage of the stage was
great—some authorities say 180 feet. Hence the scenes (eg.
the opening ol the Epidicus) where slaves hurry across the
stage, for owing to its length the audience could keep them
in sight for some time. The doors of the buildings at the back
opened outwards on to the stage. A character coming out often
talks with others inside. And, as the stage represents an
exterior, no interior is shewn. All meetings and conversations
must take place in the street. The Greek Orchestra has dis-
appeared and the space thus made vacant is filled with the
best seats.

The Chorus of the Old Greek Comedy has also disappeared,
and thus the lyric element proper was lost. The Chorus was
the bond os union in the ancient drama, the basis os its structure
as an alternation of odes and episodes. But New Comedy and
Roman Comedy consisted ol a series of soenes, which rapidly
succeeded one another. Any interval was filled up with simple
music.

Yet the lyric elenrent has not disappeared. For (a) The
moral reflections concentrated in the Greek Choral Odes are
now scattered throughout the play, or assigned to some cha-
racters os a moralising turn of mind. And these reflections are
expressed in lyric metres. (b) Again the soliloquy assumes
a prominent place. And to these two partial methods of re-
placing the Chorus we may add a third. (c) Its general function
hasbeen to some extent undertaken by the Prologue and the
Epilogue.

There is another duty of the Greek Chorus which is per-
formed by the Prologue, viz., that by which in the Parabasis the
Chorus addressed the audience in the poet's name, eg. the
Prologue os the Captivi asserts the high moral tone of the play„
much as does the Parabasis of the Clouds.

But, to go back to the lyric dement, the Greek Chorus ha
left a permanent mark on Comedy in the variety of the metre
employed. The metres of Plautus are not less numerous tha
