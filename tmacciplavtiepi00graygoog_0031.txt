xxvi INTRODUCTION

and dialogue‚ as distinguished from the excited and high-wrought
scenes.

The Tibicen served two purposes: (1) he filled up the short
intervals during which the stage was vacant, (2) he furnished an
accompaniment to all cantica, including both the cantica proper
and the trochaic scenes.

This distinction is sometimes marked in MSS. by the letters
C and DV, which indicate the musical and non-musical portions,
as Canticum and Diverbium.

(b) The Greek rule which required-with some exceptions—
that there should not be more than three actors on the stage at
once, or employed in a play,was not observed in Roman Comedy.
Often five actors are necessary. In only two os the extant plays
os PlautuS, Cistellaria and Stichus, both os which are incomplete,
would three actors be sufficient. The Epidicus-as also Captivi,
Mercator, Pseudolus-requires at least four; ten of the plays
demand at least five performers‚ the Poenulus and Rudens need
six. Ritschl conjectures seven in the Trinummus. Nor did the
Roman comedians guard against scenes in which more than
three characters spoke. On this see F. Schmidt (Zahl der
Schauspieler bei Plautus und Terentius).

(c) The division of the play into Acts has been retained
for convenience, not because it was the original arrangement.
The law which prescribes that all plays should contain five
Acts and no more was unknown to the Greeks. Aristotle (Poet.
12) gives as the constituent parts of a tragedy πρόλογος, ἐπεισ-
όδιον, ἔξοδος, χορικόν. The number os ἐπεισόδια depends upon
the number of στάσιμα by which they are divided‚ and differs in
different plays. Thus, if we reckon πρόλογος 3ηά ἔξοδος as
Acts, there will be five Acts in the Prometheus VinctuS, Septem
c. ThebaS, Agamemnon, Choephori, Eumenides; but four in
Euripides’ Supplices, Heracleidae, Iphigeneia in Tauris, Rhesus;
six in Sophocles' Ajax and Oedipus Tyrannus ; seven in Sopho-
cles’ Antigone, and in Euripides' Medea and Hercules Furens.

The law is Alexandriae and is undoubtedly observed in post-
Alexandrine writers. But the Roman comedians knew nothing
of the division into Acts, nor oi any fixed number ol Acts,
