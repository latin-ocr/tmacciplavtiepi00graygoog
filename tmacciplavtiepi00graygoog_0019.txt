xiv INTRODUCTION.

eg. Mostellaria and Miles, from the highest rank. The text of
all has not reached us quite complete. There are gaps-greater
or less-in Amphitruo, Cistellaria, Stichus-the beginning of the
Bacchides and the end of the Aulularia are lost: the Casina and
the Truculentus have suffered the worst corruptions; otherS, in-
, cluding the Epidicus, are supposed to shew signs of a double
recension. The plays are not merely amusing; though Plautus

is no moralist, the moral is combined with the comic element,
and the Captivi and Trinummus sor example handle line psycho-
logical problems. What then must have been the influence of a
great poet, who wrote perhaps 4ο plays, and whose writing ex·
tended over someno years, upon the good humour and good sense
of Rome? Great Roman authorities like Varro and Cicero have
placed Plautus very high. Horace alone (Α. P. 270, Epist. 11. 1.
170) expresses himself unfavourably about Plautini numeri and
sales, aud this unfavourable verdict is to a great extent to be ex·
plained by the wide difference between the Prosody and Metre of
the two writers.

The originals of Plautus were the Attic writers of the N ew
Comedy. The Trinummus was based upon the θησαυρός os
Philemon, the Mostellaria upon his Φάσμα. From the Ἐμπορος
of Philemon came the Mercator, from his Κληρούμενοι the
Casina. The Rudens is drawn from a play oi Diphilus, the ν
Asinaria from the Ὀναγός os Demophilus. From the great poet
of the New Comedy, Menander, come the Bacchides (Alc
ἐξαπατῶν), Poenulus (Καρχηδόνιος) and Cistellaria. lt must not
be supposed that in any case Plautus merely translated. The
phrase ‘Latine vortit Maccius' of the Prologues means ‘gave
the play its Latin dress'; the version was very free, the poet did
not scruple to depart from his original, nor to introduce many
allusions to Roman customS, events, laws, places and men, which
shew how little he was tied by the fact that he had an original
before him. The Greek framework is largely filled with pictores
taken from the Roman life around him. The modern parallel
would be not the German translations oi Shakspere, but the
Comedies constantly produced in England ‘after the French,'
where the difference between French and English taste on
