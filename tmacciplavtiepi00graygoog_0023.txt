xviii INTRODUCTION.

short. This is specially frequent if a short monosyllable pre-
cedes (Miiller, Prosod. p. 330, would confine the usage to these
cases). But ll is neglected in cavillator, simillimae, satellites,
puella, &c Ll in late Latin, as in modern Romance languageS,

had an obscure sound. Probably this was so in early Latin
and ll was only really sounded in the Augustan age. The
wn'ting of double consonants was introduced by Ennius.

The same is found with the other liquids, annona, inmor-
tales, trridiculo-before ss, dedisse, necesse, esse.

Position is also neglected before double mutes. licce is a
common case. So words compounded with it, eccum, eccam.¹
So also ecquis, quicquid, accepisti. occasio, beculto, sagitta,
adde, redde, &o

m at the end of a word was more weakly sounded than at
the beginning or in the middle of a word 1. lt did not prevent
hiatus or the blending of vowels on either side of it by syna·
loephe. Final m is frequently omitted in old inscriptions.
Even before consonants m does not lengthen its syllable, hence
before a word beginning with a consonant, enlm, quidem,
partim. Similarly in the middle of a word, nempe, bmnis.

Final s was in much the same case. lt was omitted in verbs
before ne interrogative—rogan=rogasne, iuben=iubesne, vi·
den=videsne, &c

But magis, mage, potis, pote (like amaris, amare in the 2nd
sing. pass.) are distinct forms. The longer forms magis and
potis are often written when, before another consonant, position
is neglected and the last syllable scanned short. So nimis, satis,
mimis, priris, mantis, eris, before consonants. ln Epidicus 55 is.

Similarly s with mute consonants does not make position,
sp, sc, st, quiesce, haruspex, Diespiter—est, adest, potest,
estis-rste, istic, istuc, bstendo, venustate-even with an r
following, magistratus, ministrare (Epid. 418), fenestra.

Greek words with (were written in the time of Plautus in
Latin withs or ss. Hence tarpesita (even if we write it with
the MSS. tarpezita).
