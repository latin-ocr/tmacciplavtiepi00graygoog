PREFACE.

’ ans little book lays no claim to originality. It is
an attempt to bring together such information as shall
render tlre Epidicus intelligible to an English student. And,
as the Epidicus is neither too long nor too difficub, and
possesses the advantage of being unobjectionable in tone,
it is, Ι think, a suitable play for those who have previously
read little or no Plautus. The notes are designed for such
students: they contain much that more experienced readers
will not need.

The first sections of the Introduction follow Dr Brix
(Trinummus Einleitung)‚ often very closely. The sections
ou Metre and Prosody are based on Ussing's Prolegomena,
though the view taken is not always the same as his. The
text is Goetz's (Teubner, Leipzig 1878) with occasional ’
departures‚ which are usually mentioned in the notes.
Students are referred to Goetz’s edition for the apparatus
criticus For the notes Ussing (vol. 3) has been very useful‚ ,
but perhaps even more has been drawn from the admirable
editions of the Trinummus‚ Captivi, Menaechmi and Miles

by Dr Brix. I only wish I could emulate him.

There is a difficulty about uniformity of reference iu
Plautus. Uniformity might be secured if kissings mxum-
ing were always quoted, but lirsbooltis too exhffiwmff
