in the hands of every student. As a rule my references
are made to Brix in the four plays edited by him, to
Fleckeisen in the ten plays (other than Brix’s) published
by Teubner, elsewhere to Ussing. But, except in a few
extreme cases, eg. the Casina, the differeuce in the num-
bering of a line is very small, and little trouble will, Ι hope,
be caused by the want of uniformity.

I owe many thanks to the friends who have helped
me, to Mt R. A. Neil‚ Fellow of Pembroke College‚ for
revising the' Introduction, to Mr W. A. Gill, Fellow of
Magdalene College, for criticising the notes iu manuscript,
and to my former pupil Mr F. G. Plaistowe, Fellow of
Queeus’ College, for correcting the whole iu proof. Their
help has done much to improve the book. Ι fear it still
has many shortcomings, aud shall be grateful for any
suggestions which may help to lessen them.
