xxiv “ INTRODUCTION.

Penthemimeral is more common than hephthemimeral cae-
sura. Hiatus is most common at the caesura.

The T rochaic Septenarius (tetrameter trochaicus catalecti-
cus) was employed when the speech was important or excited‚
η andis used by Plautus with great effect. There is a diaeresis
after the 4th foot which should coincide with the end of a word.
This is occasionally neglected. A tribrach [m] can be sub-
stituted for a trochee [--], except in the 7th foot where it is
rare-a spondee can be used not only in and, 4th and 6th (as in
Greek), but in 1st‚ 3rd and 5th.

The Latin admitted a dactyl instead of a spondee, save in
the 4th foot, where it is rare. Α dactyl is most common in the
first foot.

The Iambic Septenarius (tetrameter'iambicus catalecticus)
is a favourite comic metre. The treatment is the same as that
of the Senarius, except that, as there is a diaeresis after the 41h
foot‚ that foot and the 7th ought to be pure. But tribrachs‚
spondees and dactyls are found in the 7th foot.

Ortonariz', iambie and trochaic (ie. tetrametri acatalectici), are
used by Latin Comedians in highly excited scenes where great
bustle and haste are intended to be expressed. This is an
innovation, for Greek writers do not use these metres. The
diaeresis aster the 4th foot is more often neglected in octonarii
than in septenarii. Trisyllabic feet are found in the 4th place,
the 8th foot is pure.

When the excitement has passed the octonarii usually pass
into another and quieter metre, generally trochaic septenarii.

A system of octonarii is terminated by a clausula (short
verse) of kindred metm, i.e. an iambic system will finish with

iambi, a trochaic with trochees.

Similar short lines are sometimes prefixed to systems.

Trochaic octonarii are seldom long-continued.

Anapaests (generally acatalectic) are used by Plautus with
considerable licence. 'Thus a dactyl is followed by an ana·
paest, and a proceleusmatic substituted for an anapaest. The
anapaestic metre was difficolt to observe accurately in Latin.

Other metres are Cretic [-⁹-]‚ Paeonic [-m or Μ-]
