fortune-a curious contrast to Terence with the favour and
support os the great. Popular as his pieces were in the authors
lifetime he gained his full recognition only aiter death-especially
from the death os Terence to nearly the end of the Republic-
and his pieces still kept the stage aster the establishment os the
Empire. '

3. His warks. We know little of Plautus' outer life, as little
os his inner lile, of the training and equipment he had for his
literary work, nothing of his relations to his contemporaries
Naevius and Ennius, and to the art-world of his day. His
attitude to his Greek originals we can determine. The Roman
playwright who adapted for the Roman stage had two courses
open to him. He might model his play to suit Roman life,
altering the scene, the customs‚ the names, the dress and so
forth, giving a Roman tone and colouring to the whole. Or he
might with the Greek plot keep the Greek customs‚ places, lile
and characters portrayed by the Greek author. lf he adopted
the formet course the play was known as fabula togata—from
the toga, the Roman national dress, which would in that case
be worn by the actors. lf he chose the latter plan, his play was
a sabula palliata, so called from the Greek dress (pallium::
χλαμύς) which his actors wore. Plautus' plays were fabulae
palliatae. (The writers of togatae were later, and generally
represented Italian provincial life. The strict police supervision
and prohibition of politics or personalities made palliatae easier
to write and exhibit than togatae.) His originals were not the
plays of the Old Attic Comedy, politica] and personal, not the
transitional Middle Comedy, but the N ew Comedy of lise and
manners. The Old Comedy was in truth an exceptional Attic
product, which did not last long, and was incapable of re·
production save in a democracy like the Athenian. The New
Comedy from its simplicity‚ its interest depending on character-
sketching, exciting situations and developments, was specially
suitable for transplantation from Athens to Rome. The brilliant
period ol the New Comedy at Athens was the hall-century that
followed the death os Alexander the Great, its great lights were
Menander, Philemon, Diphilus. As we have seen, Livius
