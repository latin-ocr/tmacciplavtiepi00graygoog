Thus 466 lines out of 733 are extant: 14 leaves survive, 9 are
lost. But! these 14 leaves are in so bad a state that the reading
can only be deciphered with difficulty, if at all Goetz in his
presace gives an account ol the condition oi each leaf as reported
by Loewe (pp. 8-10).

ln the Codex Vetus (B) there are two correctors‚ 13², and
(occasionally) Β3 in a pale-coloured ink‚ besides corrections of
more recent date. The original scribe and 13² are often difficult
to read. There are many lacunae and erasures. The division
os the verses is that followed by Goetz in the main.

The Epidicus is the last of the eight plays included in the
British Museum MS. (J) which resembles D rather than B.
‘ln the plays not contained in D the MS. J isos the highest
value and inferior to B only because it is much more carelessly
written' (Goetz).

The fullest critical edition is Goetz (Teubner, Leipzig, 1878),
which see sor the MSS. readings and various conjectures.
Questions of reading are only noticed in the notes where the
text printed differs from Goetz’s edition. Additions to and cor-
rections of the MSS. readings are denoted by italics, but trans-
positions of the order of words are not noted
