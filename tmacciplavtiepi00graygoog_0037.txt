xxxii INTRODUCTION

Grex, the whole troupe of actors, comes forward to pronounce
the Epilogue. At least four actors are required to divide be-
tween them the leading parts, besides κῶφα πρόσωπα and
‘supers'

The performers did not wear masks till after the time of
Terence. They were distinguished by wigs, paint, &c Old
men, like Periphanes and Apoecides, wore white hair (albi, albi-
capilli Mil. 631, Bacch. 1101), long beards, and carried a staff.
Young men wore black wigs, sometimes with curls (cincinnati):
slaves had red wigs (rufi). A parasite wore a long black cloak‚
and was got up in a wretched and ludicrous style. A Miles
wore ἐπίσειστος κόμη, the hair hanging over the forehead.
Stratippocles having come from a joumey would wear petasus,
chlamys, and sword.

Afte124o Ac. there were dramatic performances at the ludi
Romani, also in 21411.e. at the ludi plebeii and Apollinares, and
from 194 uc. at the Megalesia.

In 154 lae a stone-theatre was commenced but demolished
by order of the Senate. Wooden theatres were erected each
year from 145 uta—the date of L. Mummius-from whose
time ‘ludi curatius editi' (Tac. A. 14 21). The first stone-theatre
in Rome was Theatrum Magni, built by Pompey 55 lac.

The Aediles bore the expenses of the production. They
arranged with the manager-dominus gregis-who was respon-
sible for the play, the company, the costumes and so forth. The
perfonnances were gratuitous to the public, and formed only one
part of the ludi.
