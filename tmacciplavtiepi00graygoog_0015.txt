forms to the regular drama of Livius Andronicus. The Satura
contained various dramatic representations without any unity of
plan-pictores of customs, scenes of popular life &e It is quite
distinct from the burlesque popular comedy‚ fabulae Atellanae,
an,Oscan play (ludicrum Oscnm) originating in the Campanian
town of Atella and thence transplanted to Rome. These Atel·
lanae possessed a degree of regular plot and dramatic unity,
accompanied by fixed invariable characters (Maccus, Pappus,
Bucco, Dossennus). ln the Atellanae Roman citizens appeared
as actores,· the Satnra was performed by professional players,
histriones. At a later date Atellanae were put upon the stage
as after-piaces to tragedias, and as such were termed eradio.

The Greek influence upon Roman Literature dates to the
First Punic War. Livius Andronicus (born at Tarentum not
later than 284 rte-died at an advanced age not before 208 ac.)
was brought to Rome as a prisoner of war after the capture of
Tarentum 272. He was first the slave, then the freednran of
M. Livius Salinator, and in 240 Β. c, i.e. only 50 years after the
death of Menander, when Rome was enjoying the peace that
followed the First Punic War (Hor. Epist. 11. 1. 161), brought
out the first play after a Greek original and thereby gave a
further impetus to Roman Literature, which was already fast ’
developing in this direction. His activity was devoted to
Tragedy rather than Comedy, and his style as a semigraecus
was so rough that Cicero’s dictum (Cic. Brut. 71) is Livianae
jabniae non satas dignae qnae iterum legantur.

He was followed by Cnaens Naevius (born about 274, died
rotela Campanian who came at an early age to Rome. Naevius,
who fought in the First Punic War, sung of it in Saturnian verse.
Then, in 235 nc. according to Gellius (xvn. 21. 44), he brought
out plays at Rome—fabulas apud populum dedit. Like the
poets of the Old Attic Comedy he made his plays the vehicle of
his political feelings and attacked the leading men-the Metelli
and Scipiones-with such repeated and violent invective that
he was imprisoned and was in confinement when Plautus wrote
the Miles gloriosus vv. 212 ff. (about 210 Be). He was freed
hythe tribuni plebis, but banished and died at Utica ropac.
