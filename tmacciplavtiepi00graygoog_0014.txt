1. Early Roman Commii. Roman like Greek Comedy
may be traced back to the Harvest‚ Vintage and other
Festivals. ‘The joy of harvest' found expression in alternate
verses, singer answering singer, at first playful, but gradually
becoming so personal and bitter as finally to call lor the inter·
lerence of the law. Hence sprang the versus Fescennini which
are said to derive their name from the South Etrurian town
Fescennium. Their metre was the Saturnian, the one national
Roman product in matters rhythmical‚ a mixture of the iambic
and trochaic rhythm. The Italian habitos rivals improvising
verses always has been, and still is, a favourite entertainment
among Italian rustics. ’

players (ludiones) who introduced the mimic dance without words
but with flute-accompaniment.

From the union of the Etruscan play with the versus
Fescennini arose a species of popular drama, the Satura, which
drew its name from the lanx saturae dish filled with mixed
fruits, hence a kind of poetical notuoutr'x„ or tumr mxxxix„ asu
