11. The Dramutr's Personae, Names, Dress, &c The names
are all Greek. Epidicus the slave of Periphanes gives his name
to theplay. This is common: many plays, eg. Pseudolus, Stichus,
TruculentuS, are called after the leading slave.

ἐπίδικος is properly an heiress for whose hand in marriage
her nearest of kin are claimants Here the noun is nearly equi·
valent to the participle ἐπιδικαζόμενος (cf. the Epidicazomenus of Ι
Apollodorus Ter. Phorm. prol. 25), the slave at suits with his
master and demanding from him the penalty he ought himself
to pay, ν. 724.

Thesprio (=Thesprotius from Thesprotia in S.W. Epirus)
is one of the common cases of a slave named after his birth-
place. Compare Geta, Dorio (and Dorus), Cario, Lydus, Syrus,
Syra, Thessala, Phrygia, &o

Stratippocles is a high-sounding name, like those in Aristoph.
Nub. 64, intended to typify the gay soldier who serves Mars and
Venus. Compare Stratophanes in the Truculentus and Cleo·
machus in the Bacchides.

Chaeribulus the friend of Stratippocles is branded by his
name as being ready to give his friend advice but nothing more
substantial. See 329—331.

Periphanes (‘illustrious') gives the old man's estimate of him-

Apoecides his friend is apparently so called because he could
not keep a house of his own ‚and therefore had to leave it.

The Fidicina is tlle girl hired by Epidicus to play the part of
Stratippocles' sweetheart, as his real lady-love Acropolistis had
already been brought to Periphanes as his daughter.

Philippa is the mother of Periphanes’ daughter, whom, now
that he is a widower freed from the thrall of his wealthy wife,
he is anxious to marry. For the form of the name compare
Melphidippa in the Miles, and Pleusidippus in the Rudens.

Acropolistis is a fidicina of Athens, sharp and unblushing,
to whom Stratippocles and the Soldier are both attached. Cf.
Acroteleutium in the Miles'

Danista is the usurer from Thebes who brings the third girl
Telestis, the daughter of Periphanes and Philippa,
