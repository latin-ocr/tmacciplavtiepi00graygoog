is because the n was scarcely sounded, but it may have been
that a syllable was slurred.

Cicero, Orat. 161, discusses the weak sound of final s, and
quotes instances from Lucilius, dcc, to shew how it was neglected.
Only poetae novi found it a stumbling-block. He himself pro·
nounced maximus maximu’ in his youth. Thus in Plautus, even
in the 6th foot os the Senarius, which is always a pure iambus,
and at the close os an iambic Tetrameter acatalectic (=not a
syllable short, i.e. with 8feet), and trochaic Tetrameter catalectic
(=a syllable short, i.e. with γὲ feet), s is not counted. Hence
such terminations as salvds sis, estls nunc, occidistis me, &c

Similarlya mute before a liquid does not affect the length
of the syllable, so that agros, libroS, duplex, &c are not spondees
but iambi.

We may note the following general principles of Plautine
prosody.

A. Shortening of long syllables.

The most noteworthy cases are those in which words which
we should naturally scan as iambi ( ν - ) become pyrrhic (v ν ).
When the accent or emphasis of pronunciation falls upon the
short first syllable, the second syllable instead of being long is
reckoned as short, probably because in popular pronunciation
the long unemphasised syllable was found heavy and incon·
venient. Thus we get domi, b6nls, foris-a number of inr-
peratives tend, abl, vtdt, &c Such words Ennius brought back
to their iambic scansion, and only left the short scansion in such Α
cases as bene, male ; the variable scansion in such as mihi, tibi,
sibi, ubi, volo, &c

Instances of this scansion in the Epidicus are Novd liberto
v. 727, Dedin tibi v. 703. Other representative cases are ndvd
pictura (abl), vlrds nostros, levi sententia, herl, and pdtes
adferre, though es not es (and pers. s. of sum) is the regular
scansion in Comedy.

The regular rule in later Latin is that two consonants—
except a mute before a liquid-render a preceding vowel long
by position. Double letters in Plautus do not lengthen a
vowel—especially ll. Ille, illic frequently haue uus hess synaphe
