INTRODUCTION. xxiii

gen. dat. ace, flagitium hominis, quoi homini, esse hominem.
Bergk and Corssen in these cases would write homenis, homoni,
homonem.

There is a similar hiatus before habeo, gratiam habeo; hic,
tu hunc, tu hoc, quoi haec, qua huc, and other words beginning
with h.

As might be expected hiatus is allowed in interjections,
especially after the monosyllables o, au, ah, eu, heu, em—and
with vocatives.

Generally it may be laid down that hiatus is permitted
(1) after monosyllables, (2) after dissyllables which scan as
pyrrhics whether the last syllable is naturally short or shortened‚
(3) after words of more than two syllables ‘perrarum esse hiatum
nec sine excusatione ferendum’ (Ussing, p. 224 q. v).

It will be understood that the lines are quite distinct one
from another, and that a vowel at the end of one verse followed
by another at the beginning of the next does not make an hiatus.

7. Metre. For an account of the Plautine Metres see Ussing,
pp. 174—192; with Christ, Metrik der Griechen und Romen
Miiller, Plautinische Prosodie; Spengel, Reformvorschla'ge, and
other standard works. .

Short notes on the chief metres only are here given.

The Iambz'c Senarius is the regular metre of dialogue, where
there is no excitement, but calm straightforward narrative.
Greek lambics have accustomed us to the idea that the and,
ath and 6th feet, which mark the metre, must be pure [v-].
But the Latin poets admitted spondees [--], and even ana·
paests [vv-L not only in the 1st‚3rd and 5th, but also in the
and and 4th feet. The 6th foot only must necessarily be a pure
iambus. The verse seldom ends with two iambi. Diomedes
asserts that tragic poets always wrote a spondee in the 5th
foot.

There is no objection to dactyls [-= ] provided there are not
too many, and a dactyl is seldom followed by an anapaest [ν ν -].

Most licence is allowed in the first foot‚ where a proceleus-
matic [w υ], a bacchio [- - -], ora cretic [ψ] is sometimes
found.
