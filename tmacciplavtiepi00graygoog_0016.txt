The well-known epitaph written by Naevius for himself in
Saturnians shews his Campana su'perbz'a. His Punic War is
compared by Cicero (Brut. 75) to the work of the statuary
Myron. His dramatic works, of which some fragments survive,
were mainly comic- not tragic.

2. Plautus. His great successor Titus Maca'us Plautus
(T. Maccius, not M. Accius, was proved to be his name by
Ritschl from the Ambrosian MS.) devoted his entire attention
to Comedy. Of Plautus' life but little is known. He was born
at Sarsina-now Sassina-a municipium in Umbria, and so
like most great Roman writers, Cicero, Vergil, Horace, Livy,
Tacitus, Catullus, Propertius, Terence, Pliny, Martial, &c.‚
was a provincial by birth. He came to Rome as a boy, was
known there as Plautus, a name according to Festus (p. 239 M.)
derived from a peculiarity of the feet, as the Umbrians called
a flat-footed man Plotus or Plautus. Thus Plautus is one of
the many nick-names that became hereditary cognomina, as
Scaevola, Cursor, &c He found employment as an assistant to
the stage-carpenters and scene-painters (artefices scenici), made
some money, which he lost in foreign trade, returned poor to
Rome and hired himself to a miller (pistor), and in this position
wrote his first three pieces for the stage. lf we allow time for
these experiences we cannot make him less than 30 when he
began to write. As further he was a contemporary, like Naevius,
of the two Scipios, and i's regularly coupled with them and
NaeviuS, we must assume that he began to write agood many
years before their death 212. We may then place the beginning
of his literary activity about 224 and his birth not later than
25413.e This will agree with the data we get from Cicero, viz.
that he had already written many pieces in 197 (Cic. Brut. 72),
and that he wrote the Pseudolus and T ruculentus as senex (Cic.
Cato M. 50). The Pseudolus belongs apparently to 191 lae,
and Plautus to be called senex must then have been not less
than 60years of age. He died (Cic. Brut. 60) 184 B.c. Thus
his literary activity includes the whole period of the Second
Punic War and the time of Rome’s triumph after it.

His life presents nothing but hard work, povemy, axio nixe-
